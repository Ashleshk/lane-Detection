1. lane_detection: How to Find Lane Lines on the Road using Hough transformation

    Lane line detection is a crucial feature of Self-Driving Vehicles. It's an extremely important step for detection of steering angles and localization on the road. The main goal of this project is to develop a pipeline for identification of lane lines on the Road using a series of images and video streams. This pipeline was also tested with personal stream videos.
